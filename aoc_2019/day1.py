# Fuel required to launch a given module is based on its mass. Specifically, to find the fuel required for a module,
# take its mass, divide by three, round down, and subtract 2.
#
# For example:
#
#     For a mass of 12, divide by 3 and round down to get 4, then subtract 2 to get 2.
#     For a mass of 14, dividing by 3 and rounding down still yields 4, so the fuel required is also 2.
#     For a mass of 1969, the fuel required is 654.
#     For a mass of 100756, the fuel required is 33583.
#
# The Fuel Counter-Upper needs to know the total fuel requirement. To find it, individually calculate the fuel needed
# for the mass of each module (your puzzle input), then add together all the fuel values.
#
# What is the sum of the fuel requirements for all of the modules on your spacecraft?
